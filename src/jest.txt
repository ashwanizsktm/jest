what is jest framework?

Jest is a delightful javaScript Testing framework with a focus on simplicity.

why JEST is better?

1. zero configurations: - there is no configuration required.

2. snapshots - snapshot testing is great. 
    I.  it let's u to capture a string that represents your rendered component and store it in a file,
            then you can compare it later to ensure that UI didn't change. 
    II. it makes test which keep track of larger objects with the ease.

3. Isolated
    I.  Isolated test are paralyzed by running them in their own process to maximize the performance.


4. Great API
    I.  From great api to expect just has a entire toolkit in one place.


5. Fast and safe
    I. JEST is fast and safe. what makes JEST so fast there are two things.
        1. Parallelization.
        2. To make things quick just runs previously failed test first and also it runs the slowest test first.


6. Code coverage
    I.  It can generate the coverage just by adding --coverage flag don't need to do setup for this.
    II. Can collect the code coverage information from the entire project including the untested files as well.


7. Easy Mocking
    I. It uses a custom resolver for imports in your test making it simple to mock any object outside your test scope.
    II. It can use mock the imports with rich mock functions api to spy on function calls with readable test syntex.


8. Great Exceptations
    I.  when the test fails then it provides the rich context like what is expected & what is received all those informations
        are clearly maintained.
